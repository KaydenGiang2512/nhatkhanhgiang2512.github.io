            <h3 class="u-text u-text-2">&nbsp; This branch of technology is relatively
young and constantly growing, especially in recent years due to an unexpected
surge in need for data storage, synchronization and backup coming from a large
majority of the demographic. In order to meet such high demands, the concept of
cloud computing was introduced and gradually emerged onto the scene of IT technologies
and has established itself as one of the most prevalent advancements in the
world. Prior to this, consumers were stuck with conventional forms of data
storage as their primary options, which had several inconveniences like
insufficient capacity (especially for large enterprises), hefty expenses for
buying equipment and hardware installation/repair, dependent on its devices and
lack of mobility. Cloud computing came as a fresh new choice that the industry
was in dire need for, and it has definitely been living up to the expectations
and hype.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <br>&nbsp; Nowadays, the term “Cloud computing” is virtually synonymous with data
manipulation and almost every single technologically-based operation revolves
around it to build their systems. In spite of the revolutionary impact that
cloud computing brings about, the core concepts behind this development is not
as complicated as people may think. In basic terms, cloud computing refers to
the usage of private servers on the Internet for storing, managing and
controlling data as opposed to conventional storage methods (RAM, HDD, SSD,
USBs, Floppy disks), which is restricted by the local server or internal
storage (IS) capacity of the devices that contain them. Moreover, your data
will be supervised by a third-party institution, known as a Cloud Service
Provider which helps you secure your private information and protect them from
being lost or stolen from your typical device storage.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

            <h3 class="u-text u-text-1">&nbsp; One of the greatest advantages that set this innovation apart from its predecessors is the substantial cost-savings on hardware investment and maintenance because the equipment is already purchased by the cloud service provider, so you would only need to pay for the actual service providence. Additionally, the rate of retrieving data while using cloud services is significantly higher, due to its quicker deployment times and fewer steps to acquire the necessary resources. Other distinct benefits of switching to cloud computing include unlimited storage capacity, automatic software integrations, wide-scale collaboration regardless of geographical distances, availability, advanced online security, resilient computing, etc.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; Having discussed the independent advantages that cloud computing offers, I would like to redirect to more recent implementations of this fascinating aspect of technology, such as the integration of cloud computing with mobile apps development. This is by far one of the most ambitious breakthroughs in the entire industry yet one of the cheapest, because it was able to fuse the worldwide pervasiveness and capabilities of our smartphones with the ubiquity and unlimited potential that cloud computing has brought about, without devouring an excessive amount of finance. This so called “Dynamic duo” gave birth to a new movement of cloud-based applications which can store data in vast quantities and can access them for management, backup and retrieval with ease and convenience. Also, this generation of apps are much more versatile in the sense that their data can be stored virtually compared to obsolete apps that rely on device storage, which leads to increase in performance and security.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <br>&nbsp; This incredible rise to fame has left many people baffled, with many questions such as: “How did cloud computing hit the mainstream in such a short time?” or “What made cloud computing possible?” or “How will cloud computing reshape our future?”. A surprising fact that I have discovered is that this ideology existed for decades, and not until the late 90’s did it become a reality and by the time the new millennium rolled around, cloud computing was beginning to be used in some technological facilities. The key factor here was the creation of the Internet, which perfectly supported the concept of utilizing online servers to safeguard data instead of fancy hardware.&nbsp;

over two decades leading up to present times, most people have already realized
the indispensable impact of cloud computing and its amazing functionalities in
our daily lives and in various industries such as healthcare, business,
education, apps/games development, e-commerce, logistics and supply chain
management, just to name a few. This field of technology is already reshaping
our world as we know it by gradually bridging the gap between the countries and
people from different cultures. The process of data manipulation and
transmission has never been made more available to the general public, and this
is just the beginning phase of a major revolution towards further globalization.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; Regarding the future vitality of cloud
computing, there is no concrete evidence that can accurately predict the
direction of growth that it will take, but experts have begun to make
speculations of the possible trends that could become a reality in a few years’
time. According to Data Flair and Tech Republic, 2 of the most renowned websites
specializing in data analysis and trend predictions, there are quite a few paths
that cloud computing could develop in the following years depending on how the
world advances, and what kind of technology will be invented later on.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; For instance, a whole sector of occupations
relating to the cloud has been added to the IT market in recent years, allowing
employers with more flexibility and choice to hire potential candidates to fill
these new positions, as well as adding skills requirements to current ones. Some
of these include jobs like software engineer, cloud engineer, full-stack developer,
data engineer, data scientist, etc. This creates an expansion in job
opportunities for technology enthusiasts and more options for a suitable career. Secondly, I previously stated that cloud computing has proven its
versatility by working together with other aspects of technology like mobile
applications, but this is incomparable to the collaborations we will witness in
the future. It is predicted by experts that it is possible to integrate cloud
computing into leading edge technologies such as IoT, A.I, robots, machine
learning to better enhance artificial intelligence and data communication on a
massive scale.

Prior to the popularization
of cloud computing, people have had to put up with constant annoyance from
their personal devices’ storage, and I am no exception. In the past, I have
encountered unfortunate incidents that led to data loss and insufficient
storage for important files, which I thought was a serious problem but with no
viable solutions at the time. Since switching to the cloud permanently to
manage my personal data, I noticed a significant improvement and my life has
become much more productive in terms of school materials and
assignments/projects files. Cloud computing also make teamwork and large-scale
collaborations become considerably smoother and virtually seamless, owing to
its ability to handle ridiculous amount of data transmissions all at once.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
              <br>&nbsp; Now that I am so accustomed to the presence
of cloud computing in my day-to-day activities, I simply cannot imagine my work
life without this fantastic innovation. For one thing, I am sure that my files
storage would be absolutely chaotic if I were not using cloud computing to
organize my data. Other than that, I feel that using cloud services creates a
sense of reliability for me, because I can confidently push my personal data
there without fear of my privacy being violated by hackers due to its high
security and third-party agreements.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
              <br>&nbsp; In addition, most of my family members are
also switching to the cloud as their main method of storing their information,
and they unanimously agree that this is by far the best technology for data
processing they have ever encountered. The same can be said about my friends,
who use cloud services for basically anything nowadays. What they love about
cloud computing technology is that it removes the need for hardware like USBs
or hard drives, and all you really need to access your data is an online
account for the service you are subscribed to.

            <h3 class="u-text u-text-2">&nbsp; The other branch of technology that is highly
relevant to the success of my app is none other than the field of cybersecurity
and privacy. The concept of safeguarding our private data is not new by any
means, and as a matter of fact has been around since the early days of modern
civilization, when people started to keep secrets about sensitive information and
important knowledge that cannot be shared with strangers/untrustworthy
individuals. Through time, its importance has only been growing due to constant
technological and economical advancements, which led to even more drastic
measures taken to guarantee security and prevent unwanted information leaks.
Prior to the invention and popularization of the ubiquitous World Wide Web,
most of the procedures relating to privacy and data processing was done
manually by people, oftentimes resulting in lackluster effectiveness and an
ever-imminent threat of attack from criminals who seek those data.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <br>&nbsp; After the introduction of the Internet in
1989, humanity witnessed a revolutionary development in the sense of
information manipulation and creating an online presence for themselves.
Undoubtedly, our lives are tremendously enhanced on account of the unlimited
benefits that the Internet provided, but with those advantages came a different
threat – hackers/scammers. These cyber criminals found a method to exploit the
loopholes and algorithms of the digital world and used that to their advantage
to carry out misconducts such as stealing private/crucial data, blackmailing,
false advertising, illegal transactions, draining people’s bank accounts
without their consent, implanting malware into users’ devices, the list goes
on.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
              <br>&nbsp; In order to counteract the current issues and
also to prevent potential ones, the field of cybersecurity was created to
combat hackers. The principles of cybersecurity are pretty self-explanatory – a
system designated to detecting and eradicating malware, harmful viruses and any
attempt of hacking/breaching by cyber criminals, and protecting its users and
their invaluable data during the process. However, the functionalities of
online security are not just restricted to defending electronic devices and
deleting viruses, but also entails smaller fields like data encryption, safe
transactions, digital trails, supervising online activity, shutting down
suspicious websites and ads.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; The indispensable role that cybersecurity
holds in our digitized society is more than obvious, with innumerable implementations
in our daily lives and an astounding degree of coverage. For example,
large-scale operations and enterprises always deploy a cybersecurity department
to shield themselves from nefarious attackers with intentions of acquiring
important files such as transactions data, income, sensitive files containing
confidential information that cannot be revealed to the general public and so
on. The same rule applies even for smaller companies and for applications on
every platform, where a security system is detrimental to prevent private data
from being compromised.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; Cybersecurity as a standalone industry has
the capabilities to transcend our world for the better, and it is performing
marvelously so far. Having said that, when it is integrated with other
cutting-edge technologies like A.I, Blockchain, IoT or big data, cybersecurity
becomes a much more powerful tool and can navigate the cyber threat landscape
with higher efficiency. Using the features that A.I offers, cybersecurity can
be upgraded into an intelligent automatic system that constantly scans the web
for insights on hackers, cyber threats, on which they devise prevention
strategies. Another instance is when online security collaborates with
blockchain technology, which results in a fortified layout of defense against
any incoming threats. Apart from the relatively secure browsing environment
that cybersecurity has, adding the concepts of blockchain ensures safe
transactions of all types and maximize privacy of data and transparency.

around the world at a rapid pace, and the practice of sharing data and
knowledge on a virtual platform is becoming stronger than ever. Although this
movement obviously has a plethora of benefits to humanity, it also makes our
privacy and data easily exposed to nefarious cyberattacks at the same time.
Therefore, the vital influence of cybersecurity and its necessity in our
current age goes without saying, and that’s part of the reason why this is one
of the leading fields of research for developments. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <br>&nbsp; Thanks to the full implementation of this
incredible aspect of technology, browsing the web has never been more reliable,
and the Internet itself is gaining even more optimistic perspective from its
users. Nowadays, there is always a sense of reassurance that your device is
under protection whenever you visit a new website, download an app, go on
social media, making important transactions involving currency, use your mobile
devices or having private conversations on messaging platforms. This feeling of
security would not have been possible if it were not for those systems keeping
watch over our online behavior and sends us warnings of imminent threats.
Essentially, the greatest advantage of cybersecurity is that it promotes
privacy and guarantees that your digital life is no longer vulnerable to
hacking or scamming risks.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <br>&nbsp; Furthermore, the expansion of cybersecurity
and its subset of branches gradually led to a significant change in the job
market, with loads of new occupations introduced by many companies to match the
high demand of online security and hacker retaliation. Some of these include
information security analyst, chief information security officer, lead software
security engineer, penetration tester (white-hat hacker), cyber crime
investigator, and so much more. The good thing about this technology is that it
does not render an older industry obsolete, but rather elevating them to higher
standards in preparation for the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

            <h3 class="u-text u-text-2">&nbsp; From a personal point of
view, to say that cybersecurity improved my life is an understatement because
the impact it has on my day-to-day activities are profound. By downloading some
authorized cybersecurity software, I am constantly notified of the current
state of my personal devices and all traces of anomalies or potential breaches,
and of course how to resolve them effectively. The last step is configured to
function automatically, regardless of whether I am running these apps or not,
which is extremely convenient when I am occupied with other tasks and cannot
find the time to manually eliminate these issues. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; The difference that cybersecurity brings to
my daily life routines is quite significant due to the fact that I am an IT
student, so the majority of my work and communication is largely dependent on
the Internet and applications. On account of these security systems, I can
confidently use online platforms like these to my own preferences without
hesitation, since my privacy and personal data is shielded all the time.
Another change is in my behavior while browsing the web, where I have become
significantly more cautious because I understand what is at stake, and what
kind of scams are present on the Net. Cybersecurity does not simply make your
problems disappear, but it also shows you those issues, describe their
characteristics and severity, and finally how to recognize and avoid similar
threats later on.
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <br>&nbsp; My family and friends have experienced the
benefits of using cybersecurity, and I have to say that they were deeply
impressed by the practicality of it. Similar to me, my family loves to surf the
web mostly for entertainment purposes like social media, Youtube videos,
movies, etc. They mentioned that every time a slight cyber threat was on the
horizon, a notification popped up and gave them the option to let the built-in
security system eradicate the issues for them, which relieved the headache of
having to go through the list of risks and fix all of them one by one. When it
comes to my friends, who are also engaged with online activities, say that they
have yet to encounter any problems regarding their data’s privacy, and this
clearly helped them focus more on their desired plans instead of diverting
attention to worry about hackers.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

thing that sparked my interest was how relaxed the working environment is,
despite Google being one of the foremost innovators of technology. Clement
shared that tech companies do not typically obsess over being early at work or
leaving late at night. In fact, what they really take into consideration is how
well you complete your tasks and emphasizes relaxation to boost creativity, not
the time you spend sitting at your desk working. His scope of duty is writing
code, doing code reviews, designing, participating in group projects assigned
by the boss and attending meetings. He is surprisingly interactive with his
co-workers, and leads a very active lifestyle. Software engineers like him do
not interact too much with customers or clients, because that is not his
department. Most of their day is usually spent at the office (working area)
with small intervals where they can have a break and grab a quick snack. According
to Clement, designing is actually quite challenging for him, because Google
takes designing very seriously so standards are very high.</h3>

here compared to the previous jobs.</h3>
